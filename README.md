# Discord Global Chat Bot!
- A basic and simple global chat bot, completely open source, just for you!

# How does it work?
- Basically, it checks for any messages sent in a specific channel, which should be named ```global-chat```. Then, it loops through its guilds and checks if the guild has a channel named ```global-chat```. If yes, then it sends the message there. 

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
- You need to have the members intent enabled for your bot. Otherwise the code would not work. For more information about intents [click here](https://dis.gd/gwupdate).

# Setup instructions.
- Firstly, fill in config/config.json by putting your token in there. Then install all the dependencies using ```npm install```.

# To start the bot:
- Run the command ```node index.js``` in your terminal and the bot should be up and running!
